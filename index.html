                <p dir="ltr"><span>The Dually Wheels Set (6) 10x225 20x8.25 is a professionally engineered upgrade designed specifically for Ford F450, F550, and F600 models, making it a premium choice for both modern rigs and restorations. Featuring a rugged 20x8.25-inch diameter and a 10x225mm bolt pattern, this six-wheel package delivers the ideal combination of strength, proper fitment, and aggressive aesthetics for high-demand applications. </span></p>
                <p dir="ltr"><span>Each wheel is built from forged aluminum alloy, ensuring a superior strength-to-weight ratio when compared to cast alternatives. This material choice also offers better resistance to corrosion, especially critical for trucks exposed to harsh work environments or off-road conditions. Precision-machined hub bores and bolt patterns guarantee an exact fit without the need for spacers or adapters, which improves safety and long-term reliability.</span></p>
                <p dir="ltr"><span>These wheels are also engineered to accommodate dual rear wheel (DRW) setups, supporting high load ratings required for towing trailers, heavy equipment, or recreational haulers. The 20x8.25 size allows for a wider tire selection and improved contact patch for enhanced traction, braking, and ride comfort.</span></p>
                <p dir="ltr"><span>Whether you're overhauling your truck for show, building a tow rig, or restoring to outperform its original form, this wheel set gives you modern-day performance and timeless dually styling in one durable package.</span></p>
